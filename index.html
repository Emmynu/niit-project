            <p>Bluegate School was established in January 1985. As a result of our rich curriculum and the excellent academic performance of our students over the years, our school has become one of the most sought-after international schools in Lagos and all over Nigeria.</p>
  
            <p>  At Bluegate, we understand how boys and girls grow and learn. Therefore, we use a modern curriculum that makes learning easy for our students. Furthermore, all our teachers are certified, and our classes are equipped with state-of-art learning facilities.</p>
            
            <p>Although we are one of the few British international schools in Nigeria that strictly run a British curriculum, we are proudly Nigerians. While we train our students to become global citizens, we celebrate the values and heritage of Nigeria.
            </p>
              <p>We adopt the Montessori Method in our Preschool; the International Primary Curriculum (IPC) in our Elementary School; the National British Curriculum, which is designed to effectively prepare our students for the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE)examination, in our Secondary School; and the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme in our Sixth Form.</p>
